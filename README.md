Timed quiz about coding

## Description

The purpose of this Coding Quiz Project is to allow bootcamp students to further their skills of creating a page from scratch while also applying skills learned about the DOM. Students have to use the DOM in Javascript to make edits to the page and grab certain elements to use in event listeners, providing functionality to the page while also making changes that are not already in the html and css.
